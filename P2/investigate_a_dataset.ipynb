    "Though I expect there will not be a strong correlation between these two variables, this surprised me.\n",
    "I though the relationship won't be such weak.<br>\n",
    "Some reasons caused the result:\n",
    "  - Different batting skill is required for different kind of long hit. A player need to hit the ball toward the 'hole' between defensive players. Or make the ball go along on sideline. Sometimes he need to know how to utilize the ballpark for hit a ground rule double. A great player can use different skills in different situation, but not all players have all those skills.\n",
    "  - Power matters. A powerful hitter can launch a line drive go out of the wall. But a line drive by a normal hitter may become a double or get caught by the outfielder.\n",
    "  - Batting strategy can also affect the result. Some players may focus on specific pitch to crush the ball with a big hit. While some other players try to make contact with every ball in the strike zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BB per PA<br>\n",
    "I think the plate discipline is totally different with batting skill such as how to swing effectively and smoothly, make contact, or follow through well. But a skilled hitter can benefit from all the skill because the pitcher can't attack him with strike easily. So I think it is normal if the walk has some sort of relationship, but not a strong kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SF per PA<br>\n",
    "Sacrifice fly and home run are similar that the batter is credited with at least 1 *RBI*. Yes, a [multiple runs sacrifice fly](http://m.mlb.com/news/article/36494110//) is possible. And they are both fly ball. But I have no idea that how the sacrifice fly should related to the home run. The correlation coefficient does not suggest a strong relationship too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RBI per PA<br>\n",
    "The strongest correlation is between home run per *PA* and runs battered in per *PA*.\n",
    "Consider the fact that every home run always battered at least 1 run, the coefficient 0.630265 is not strong enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be other some reasons out of my head.\n",
    "And of course I have no evidence if the reasons I mentioned above is the real or not.\n",
    "There are all speculation without experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I tried to examine the relationship between home run and other batting stats.\n",
    "I perform the analysis just using the simple average stats.\n",
    "After a series of exploration and statistic test, I found it is still difficult to conclude whether the relationship exist or not.\n",
    "It is not appropriated using a single stats to evaluate a batter's performance because many factors affect batting.\n",
    "That is why baseball statistics have something like Slugging Percentage (SLG) and Isolated Power (ISO) for measuring hitter ability.\n",
    "And Sabermetrics developed many advanced statistics method such as WAR, BABIP, weighted statistics, etc.\n",
    "It will be interesting to learn more data analysis techniques and think in statistic way, and then invent or perform some advanced method to mine new findings for this everyday sport."
